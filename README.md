Having fun.
FUN FACTS | Born in South Africa but grew up in the Cotswolds, UK. I am 'owned' by a magical little 2-year old boy with an 'old soul', 1 horse, 2 dogs and 1 cat.At the age of 21, I was suddenly paralyzed for almost 2 years due to a rare illness and went on to make a miraculously full recovery. It was a serious test of mind and body!
